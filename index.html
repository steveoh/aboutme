                            Led a team of 3 to build an ASP.NET web application project planning tool
                            for the DNR that allows 400+ users to plan restoration projects across
                            Utah. Users will apply for access and be approved by an official. They
                            are then able to create projects. Project creation involves tabular data
                            input and digitizing project features (guzzlers, fences, pipelines) on
                            a web map. Planners then are able to use GIS information to help decision
                            making and create reports.

                            with the goal of reducing salinity in the Colorado river as well as to
                            foster sustainable grazing. Planners across the state create features on
                            a map representing their proposed project areas. Project resources are created
                            on the map and contract or grant prices are determined by their area, length,
                            or amount. These proposals are approved by UDAF and tracked through completion
                            with the help of this web application.

                        In the time that I have worked here, I have helped grow a successful
                        software development team. I have created processes for requirement gathering,
                        bug tracking, source control protection, testing and deployment routines.
                        I lead the analysis, design, and development of multiple complex web based
                        GIS applications and web services that support the public, our clients,
                        and staff. We have shipped many products and continue to design great products
